# PDF-to-CSV converter
Convert many PDF files to CSV for data mining purposes. Tables remain readable.

You can process a whole folder with or without subfolders and can peak (extra Button) beforehand how many PDF-files will be processed.

Here is an example of my recent use-case for this kind of program:

The conversion is not perfect, but therefore functional for nearly every PDF. You have to modify the code for even better results. PDF formats are too unpredictable for a one-fits-all solution.

My program can be immediately started with the .exe in the 'debug'-folder.  

I used this nice repo for development (many thanks to Justabhi96): https://github.com/Justabhi96/Detect_And_Extract_Table_From_Pdf/tree/df6d3aace3012612d437779efd181daa6dd5ef06
