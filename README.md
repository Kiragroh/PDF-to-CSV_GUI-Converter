# PDF-to-CSV converter
Convert many PDF files to CSV for data mining purposes. Tables remain readable.

You can process a whole folder with or without subfolders and can peak (extra Button) beforehand how many PDF-files will be processed.

Here is an example of my recent use-case:

The conversion is not perfect, but therefore functional for nearly every PDF. You have to modify the code for even better results. PDF formats are too unpredictable for a one-fits-all solution.
